# Interactive Multi-Agent Parallel Pathfinding Simulator (IMAPPS)
An interactive multi-agent pathfinding simulator in Python using Pygame and multi-processing modules for parallel A * path computations and optimizations. 

## Key Features:
- Agents can move freely in all the directions in 2D space.
- Dynamically place/delete agents, their goals and obstacles on a grid.
- Change one agent's goals and re-assign positions in real-time.
- Measure time performance of A * path calculations.
