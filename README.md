# Interactive Multi-Agent Parallel Pathfinding Simulator (IMAPPS)
An interactive multi-agent pathfinding simulator in Python using Pygame, and multi-processing modules for parallel A* path computations and optimizations. This repository contains both the serial and parallel implementations of the simulator.

## Key Features:
- Agents can move freely on a 2D grid space.
- Place agents, goals and obstacles with easy mouse controls.
- Agents can dynamically replan their paths if blocked by other agents.
- Measure time performance of A* path calculations.

## Controls:
- Press T to toggle Wall Mode. Then use Left Click to place/remove walls.
- Press Right Mouse Button to place Agents.
- Press Middle Mouse Button to place Goals.
- Press Space bar to run the simualation.
