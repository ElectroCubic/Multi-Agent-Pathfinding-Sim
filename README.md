# Interactive Multi-Agent Parallel Pathfinding Simulator (IMAPPS)
An interactive multi-agent pathfinding simulator in Python using Pygame, and multi-processing modules for parallel A* path computations and optimizations. 

## Key Features:
- Agents can move freely in 2D space.
- Dynamically add/remove agents, their goals and obstacles on a grid.
- Re-assign agents' goals and positions in real-time.
- Measure time performance of A* path calculations.
