# Interactive Multi-Agent Parallel Pathfinding Simulator (IMAPPS)
An interactive multi-agent pathfinding simulator in Python using Pygame, and multi-processing modules for parallel A* path computations and optimizations. This repository contains both the serial and parallel implementations of the simulator.

## Key Features:
- A*-based pathfinding for each agent
- Parallelized execution using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing
- Configurable grid size and number of agents
- Agents move orthogonally (4-ways) in a 2D grid space.
- Place agents, goals and obstacles with easy mouse controls.
- Agents can dynamically replan their paths if blocked by other agents.
- Measure time performance of A* path calculations.

## Pathfinding Algorithm:
### A* Algorithm

Each agent computes the shortest path to its goal using the A* algorithm, defined by: <br>
- Heuristic used: Manhattan distance <br>
- Cost Function: f(n) = g(n) + h(n) <br>
- Neighbors: 4-directional (up, down, left, right) <br>
- Obstacles: Cells marked as blocked are ignored during path expansion. <br>

## System Requirements:
- Python version: 3.13 or newer
- OS: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- RAM: 4GB or more
- CPU:  
  - Minimum: Dual-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3)  
  - Recommended: Quad-core or higher (e.g., Intel Core i5/i7, AMD Ryzen 5/7)
